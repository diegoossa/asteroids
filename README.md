# Asteroids Code Challenge

This is my version of the classic Asteroids game. 

It is built on [Unity 2022.3.23f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.18), the latest LTS version available. It is also using the latest public DOTS packages, and third party tools, like [Extenject](https://github.com/Mathijs-Bakker/Extenject).
